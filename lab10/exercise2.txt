Matrix multiplication C[i + j * n] += A[i + k * n] * B[k + j * n]

Checkoff Question 1: The innermost loop increments i, moving through matrices with strides 1, 0, 1
Checkoff Question 2: The innermost loop increments k, moving through matrices with strides n, 1, 0
                  If the innermost loop increments j, moving through matrices with strides 0, n, n
Checkoff Question 3: The smaller strides in the innermost loop, the faster it runs.
