Scenario 1
    1. Hit rate is 0 because step size (a1) in bytes is exactly equal to block size.
    2. 0%
    3. Change step size to 1 will increase hit rate to 50%.

Scenario 2
    1. There are 2 memory accesses per iteration of the inner loop.
    2. Hit/Miss pattern: MHHH.
    3. Hit rate goes closer to 100%.

Scenario 3
    1. L1 50%, L2 0%, Overall 50%.
    2. 32 of L1 accesses, 16 of L1 misses.
    3. 16 of L2 accesses. L2 is accessed only if L1 misses.
    4. Increase rep counts.
    5. (1) L1 hit rate stays the same, (2) L2 hit rate stays the same, as we increase the number of blocks in L1;
       (3) L1 hit rate increases, (4) L2 hit rate stays the same, as we increase the L1 block size.

Checkoff Question 1: Hit rate is still 0 because with step size to be 8, all accessed elements are mapped to the first block of cache. Rep count has no impact on hit rate.
Checkoff Question 2: Step size and option.
Checkoff Question 3: Hit rate is 75%.
Checkoff Question 4: Cache size is exactly equal to array size. After one iteration of the outer loop, all elements are cached and no more cache miss will happen.
Checkoff Question 5: As we iterate over the same array, replaced block in L1 due to capacity restriction can be accessed in L2 cache.
